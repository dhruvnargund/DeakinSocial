# DeakinSocial
A Deakin university specific social media web app for networking and connecting with other people.

## Temporary Readme Update 
I'm adding this to make sure we are all on the same page heading into full-time development.

We'll be using the following as our file structure:
--controllers/
--models/
--public/
--routes/
--views/
--server.js

### controllers/
Will contain our logic controllers.

### models/
This will contain our db schemas, etc. 
MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
Required. Install complete version. Add MongoDB Compass if you want, it's a GUI for performing CRUD operations on your databases, but it isn't required.

### public/
Contains our templates, HTML files, assets. Are we intending to use any templating like Pug?

### routes/
This will contain our routing files

### server.js
